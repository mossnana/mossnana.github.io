### Glad to see you here!

I graduated from Chiang Mai University as a geological science major. However, after three years of work, I learned a new skill to change my career path to a programmer. I have learned programming skills for three months. I got a job offer from Almacom Thailand for an ERP developer. After almost a year as an ERP developer, I have learned a lot of things about the development process -- Python programming language, Odoo ERP framework, Bash command/script, SSH, Vim, Tmux, etc. Next, I moved to a new company (Polymorph) for experience. I was on the job learning in Flutter for six months. I moved to a new company (Magic Box Solution). I learned some dev-ops skills such as docker, k8s setting, etc. After a year in Magic Box Solution, the company sent me to be outsourced staff (FWD, Sirius).
Over five years as a developer in web development industries, My favorite industries are ERP and Finance. I think I can do a back-end side better than a front-end side.
Now, I'm learning basic data structures and algorithms because I realized I can't solve almost all problems in leetcode by myself. So, I think it's time to learn computer science concepts.
